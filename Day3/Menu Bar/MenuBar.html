          <h1>How TO Center a Div</h1>
          <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">The Ultimate Guide to Centering in CSS</h3>

          <p>
            For a long time, centering an element within its parent was a surprisingly tricky thing to do.
            As CSS has evolved, we've been granted more and more tools we can use to solve this problem.
             These days, we're spoiled for choice!<br>
            I decided to create this tutorial to help you understand the trade-offs between different
            approaches, and to give you an arsenal of strategies you can use, to handle centering 
            in all sorts of scenarios.<br>
            Honestly, this turned out to be way more interesting than I initially thought üòÖ.
            <br>
            Even if you've been using CSS for a while, I bet you'll learn at least 1 new strategy!
          </p>

          <h2 style="color: firebrick;">Centering with auto margins</h2>
          <p>
            The first strategy we'll look at is one of the oldest.
            <br>
            If we want to center an element horizontally, we can do so using margins set to the special value auto:
            <br>
            First, we need to constrain the element's width; by default, elements in Flow layout will expand horizontally to fill the available space, and we can't really center something that is full-width.
            I could constrain the width with a fixed value (eg. 200px), but really what I want in this case is for the element to shrinkwrap around its content. fit-content is a magical value that does exactly this. Essentially, it makes ‚Äúwidth‚Äù behave like ‚Äúheight‚Äù, so that the element‚Äôs size is determined by its contents.
            Why am I setting max-width instead of width?
            <br>
            Well, my goal is to stop the element from expanding horizontally. I want to clamp its maximum size. If I used width instead, it would lock it to that size, and the element would overflow when the container is really narrow. If you drag that ‚ÄúContainer Width‚Äù slider all the way to the left, you can see that the element shrinks with its container.
            Now that our element is constrained, we can center it with auto margins.
            I like to think of auto margins like Hungry Hungry Hippos. Each auto margin will try to gobble up as much space as possible For example, check out what happens if we only set margin-left: auto:<br>
            When margin-left is the only side with auto margins, all of the extra space gets applied as margin to that side. When we set both margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto, the two hippos each gobble up an equal amount of space. This forces the element to the center
